## Overview

When we began building Exceptionless, an open source error and event reporting service, 
we ran into many difficult development problems. When we launched version 1, we thought 
we had everything figured out, but then we ran into issues with scaling. For 2.0, we 
decided to rewrite the core pieces of Exceptionless to allow for scalability and faster 
feature development. When we were done, we felt like those new core pieces could be used 
by the development community, so we created Foundatio.  Foundatio makes it painless to 
quickly build pluggable and scalable distributed apps. In this talk, I want to cover 
how we built and scaled Exceptionless, and how you can use Foundatio to improve your story!
