# Exception Driven Development

## Overview
If customer facing issues are your top priority, then you already adhere to the primary principle 
of Exception Driven Development.

It's a pretty simple concept: Collect application data, especially regarding errors and crashes, 
and then focus on fixing those problems that your users are actually experiencing.
